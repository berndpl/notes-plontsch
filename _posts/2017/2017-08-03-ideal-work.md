title: "Ideal Work"

### People
The team you work with : A group of people that you look up to, that you want to learn from. People that give you honest feedback. People that insipire you and get insipired. People who care.

The person you work for : Somebody who respects you, values your contribution, is mindful of your time. Somebody you trust. Somebody who provides direction without telling you what to do. Somebody who connects and supports you. Somebody who helps you focus.

## Work
You work on something that you feel is worth spending tons of time on, that allows you to go deep, that has an effect on people, that inspires to be explored from different angles. Work that matters to you. Work you care about.

### People or Work
People and work. If one is lacking—That’s okay. Focus on the good parts. Work is not everything. Time to get a hobby.

If both are lacking—You leave.
