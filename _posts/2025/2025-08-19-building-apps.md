title: "Building an App is Becoming like Journaling"

Everybody can build their own apps now.

It’s easy to get started and it’s very rewarding when you stick to it, evolving an idea in tiny steps over time.

Revolving around your ever changing needs and preferences.

Sometimes you need a fresh start and that’s okay, too. 
You’ll build on your learnings. Your app becomes more personal and more effective over time. Your very own needs at the center.

Apps are becoming the most personal and the most accessible they’ve ever been.
