Your data is the most precious thing. Apps should be build around your data, not the other way around. 

You should always be in full control to see what’s stored, move it around and rest assured that even if don’t touch it for 10 years, it’ll still be around and be perfectly accessible even if the app around your data won’t—which is extremely likely.

What’s more durable, portable and accessible than a folder with a bunch of text files. Why aren’t most apps build around just that? Are those apps really that special?
