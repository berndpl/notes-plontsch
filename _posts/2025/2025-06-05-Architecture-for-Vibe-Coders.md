"Scaling Software Architecture For Vibe Coders" A book that needs to exist now. 

It’s not about writing code that works anymore. It’s about creating it in a way that you can feel accountable for. A path forward for your project to grow without losing control. A perspective on how functionality can be isolated so iteration becomes fast while a sense of ownership remains on your side.
