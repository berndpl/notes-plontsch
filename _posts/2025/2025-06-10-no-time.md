> “Technology doesn’t just make old tasks easier. It creates entirely new standards. [...] Before washing machines, families used to wash clothes maybe twice a week. After that, weekly laundry became the norm.”

> "Human skills will be commoditized. But human beings will not. We are un-LLM-able."

> “The bottleneck to great work is not knowledge, it’s not information, it’s not even intelligence. It’s that intangible quality, call it taste, creativity, judgement, courage, intuition, agency.”

> “First […] I feared that machines were becoming more human. An yes, it’s becoming harder to tell the difference. But that’s not just because machines are becoming more machine-like. It’s because humans becoming more machine-like”

> “We try to measure what we value but inevitably end up valuing what we measured.”

> “The biggest problems are not technological, they are philosophical. They are questions of values, ethics and world views.”

> “Will AI replace us? Yes. But fearing that AI will replace us is like fearing that our children will replace us. Yes they will replace us because that is why we created them. But also they depend on us, they are us and they can improve us."
