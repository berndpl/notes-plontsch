title: "A license for vibes"
---

With the effort of creating and shipping a new app approaching zero, a new question arises: what license should you choose when sharing the code of your project on Github?

A license that encourages the open, collaborative spirit of a weekend project, but doesn't feel like a corporate giveaway. Encouraging people to join the party and build together, but with a gentle brake on purely commercial redistribution.

There's a new dynamic shaped by rapid, community driven creation that feels different. Does it call for a new kind of license? One that protects the "vibe" of a project without closing it off?

So, what about...

*   **MIT License:** This is the most permissive. **Nice:** Anyone can use, modify, and distribute your work, which is great for adoption. **Con:** They can also sell it without giving you a cut. It’s total freedom, for better or worse.

*   **GPL (GNU General Public License):** This license is the bedrock of "copyleft." **Nice:** It ensures that any project using your code must also be open source. **Con:** This can be too restrictive for many commercial uses, which might scare away potential collaborators.

*   **Creative Commons (CC):** Primarily for creative works, not code. **Nice:** The "NonCommercial" version seems perfect for passion projects. **Con:** It’s not designed for software and can create legal confusion about what constitutes "non commercial" use.

None of these feel quite right. The MIT is too loose, the GPL is too strict, and CC might be a good fit if there would be a proven equivalent covering software specifically.

What licenses are you using for your passion projects? I'd love to hear what feels right to you.
