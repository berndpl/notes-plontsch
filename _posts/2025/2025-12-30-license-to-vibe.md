title: "A license for vibes"
---

With the effort of creating and shipping software approaching zero I am wondering how this new dynamic affects the choice of picking the right license for your latest creation. One that protects the "vibe" of a project without closing it off. A license that encourages the open, collaborative spirit of e.g. a weekend project but with a gentle brake on out of control commercial redistribution and scalping.

So, what about...

- MIT License The most permissive. Anyone can use, modify, and distribute your work – great for adoption. But they can also sell it without giving you a cut. Total freedom, for better or worse.
- GPL (GNU General Public License) ensures that any project using your code must also be open source. Sounds nice, but maybe a little too restrictive for many commercial uses.
- Creative Commons (CC): Primarily used for creative works, not code. The "NonCommercial" version seems to match nicely with what I was looking for. However it doesn't seem to be designed for software which might create legal confusion about what constitutes "non commercial" use.

What licenses are you using for passion projects you would share publicly e.g. on Github? I'd love to hear what feels right to you and why.
