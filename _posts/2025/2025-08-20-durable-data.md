title: "Durable data"

Your data is the most precious thing. Apps should be build around your data, not the other way around. 

You should always be in full control to see what’s stored, move it around and rest assured that even if you don’t touch it for 10 years, it’ll still be around and be perfectly accessible even if the app around your data won’t, which is extremely likely.

Historically the most durable, portable and accessible place for data storage is a simple folder with text files files. Why aren’t most apps build around just that? Do they really need to?
