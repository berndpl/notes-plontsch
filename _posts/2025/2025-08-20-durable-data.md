title: "Durable data"

Your data is precious. More than ever. 

Apps will be build around your data, not the other way around. 

You will be in full control: able to see what is stored, move it around, and rest assured that even if you don’t touch it for 10 years, it’ll still be there and perfectly accessible—even if the app built around your data isn’t, which is extremely likely.

Historically, the most durable, portable, and accessible way to store digital data is a simple folder with text files optimzed for human readability in content, naming and structure. 

Why aren’t most apps built around just that as a foundation?
