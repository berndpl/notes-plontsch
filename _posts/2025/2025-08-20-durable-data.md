title: "Durable data"

Your data is the most precious thing. Apps will be build around your data, not the other way around. 

You will always be in full control: able to see what’s stored, move it around, and rest assured that even if you don’t touch it for 10 years, it’ll still be there and perfectly accessible—even if the app built around your data isn’t, which is extremely likely.

Historically the most durable, portable and accessible place for data storage is a simple folder with text files files. Why aren’t most apps build around just that? Do they really need to?
