title: "Ideal Meetings"
---

Not all meetings are bad. Meeting people can be energizing and bonding as long as everybody is able to contribute equally. The ideal duration of a meeting depends largely on the number of people participating. Something like…

### 2 People, 30 minutes

This is a high intensity meeting for critique, feedback and quick back and forth. It’s the most personal of all meetings, an opportunity for honesty but also easy to derail. Consider moving all the personal, vague parts into a more public and relaxed environment e.g. while making coffee together.

If this type of meeting is longer, it becomes exhausting and unfocussed.

### 4 People, 60 minutes
This can be the most energizing type of meeting for a small group of people. Creating momentum as a team with everybody being empowered to take an active role. Thoughts can be expressed and evolved together. It’s just enough time to reflect on what is being said without the need to hold back or being afraid of speaking to a bigger mostly silent audience.

After 60 minutes everybody had the chance of contributing something. If this type of meeting is shorter there’s a risk of becoming a one way discussion where single people contribute and benefit disproportionaly.

> The greatest value of meeting people in person is to hear them talk and see them think

### More People?
If you involve more people don’t expect equal contribution. Awkward silences will happen. A divide between people speaking and people be passive will increase.
Consider other asyncronous formats as extension of your in-person meeting to allow a more reflected contribution and preparation for everybody. Nice side effect, this also helps to be inclusive of those struggling with speaking up in front of an audience.

### Longer?
You are exhausting people. Nobody can be active or focused for that long.
Make it tentative. Create clear sections and breaks where people are encouraged to leave when they got what they needed. Share a short summary to reduce everybody’s fear of missing out.

### A big red LED clock
Every meeting room needs a big red shiny LED clock in sight for all participants. It acts as a ruthless signal for delays and helps reminding everybody to keep themselves short and on the point.

Happy meeting.
