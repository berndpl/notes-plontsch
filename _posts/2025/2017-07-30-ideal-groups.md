There’s an ideal amount of people for achieving a specific goal. Some possible patterns…

### 5 People
A passionate team

Building a feature or product. 2 designers. 2 engineers. 1 person as glue and external communication, helping the others to focus.

### 4 People
An engaged discussion

Having a discussion with equal contribution. Allowing everybody to reflect on the conversation without becoming passive.

### 3 People
A good decision 

Achieving a balanced decision that feels well rounded without becoming mediocre by consense. For bigger teams those 3 decision makers must ensure to be well informed and trusted by the rest of the team.

### 2 People
A constructive critique

Keeping critique between 2 people allows it to be honest and constructive without causing embarrassment and shame.

Happy team working.
