title: "Lonely Users"

What happens when everyone builds their own personal software?

There was something (mostly) beautiful about open source and how it created a truly collaborative foundation of both users and creators.

With AI doing the creation and everyone building their own tools, the community of creators becomes just 2, the AI and yourself.

And the community of users becomes just 1, yourself.

### The turnaround

Maybe the community isn't about the shared experience of using the same tool or crafting that singular code base but supporting each other's ongoing process in building their own versions.

Sharing your work. Inspire each other. Help each other how to level up.

There will still need to be a shared language. The Lego system, the frameworks, the CLI, the PRD md file, or at least formulating of what we are solving and how it should feel. And maybe this tendency of becoming more "meta" even leads to connecting it all to support a greater good.

### Will there still be a space for community in software? 

I think so. But it will need to find a new playing field or expression.
