title: "Lonely Users"
---

What happens when everyone builds their own personal software but nobody contributes to each other's work?

There was something (mostly) beautiful about open source and how it was created a truly collaborative foundation of both users and creators.

With AI doing the creation and everyone building their own tools, the community of creators becomes just 2, the AI and yourself.

And the community of users becomes just 1, yourself.

Will there still be a space for community in software? I think so. But it will need to find a new space or expression.
