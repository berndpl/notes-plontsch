Compounding. The concept that helped make sense of putting your money in index funds just got a little sibling. "[Compound engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file)" is here to formalize how AI-driven creation might scale beyond vibe micromanagement. The idea is fascinating and tranquilizing but it does come with a catch: you have to commit fully for it to actually work.

The dream of a perfect flywheel of planning, executing and reflecting where humans fully retreat from execution and re-focus all efforts on steering.

I am curious to see how the same idea might diffuse through all types of creation processes. 

Is compounding really the ultimate goal? And how might we get from "more" to actually “better"?
