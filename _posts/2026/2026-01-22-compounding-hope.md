Compounding. The concept that helped make sense of putting your money in index funds just got a little sibling. Compound engineering is here to formalize how AI-driven creation might scale beyond vibe micromanagement. The idea is fascinating and tranquilizing but it does come with one catch: you have to commit fully for it to actually work.

The dream of a perfect flywheel of planning, executing, and reflection where humans fully retreat from execution and re-focus all efforts on steering and reflecting.

I am curious to see how the same idea might diffuse through all types of creation processes. 

Is compounding really the ultimate goal? How might we get from "more" to actually “better"?
