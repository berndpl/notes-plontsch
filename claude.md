# Blog with Notes
+ This is my personal blog where I collect personal notes
+ Using Jekyll 
+ Hosted on Github
+ For colors I am using the catpuccin color theme
+ A gnerated style guide saved as /style.html to be updated when any of the css is changed

### Preview
- Help me preview the blog locally

### Posts
- I am collecting notes saved as indiviual posts in the /_posts/ folder
- Never edit or change anything in this posts folder

### Visual
- Some notes contain animation visuals
- check if there is a file with "_visual.md" at the end. if so create a new visual stored in the "assets/images/<year>" folder
- make sure the visual style is consistent
- Add the gnerated visual to the post

### Generated Pages

Everytime I add a new posts the pages for questions and insights need to be re-generated.
Use a distinct color tone for content that is generated

- Add a short paragraph with a short 2 sentence summary highlighting some shared themes. Telling what this page is about. Short message encouraging replying with answers. Don't write with a subjective "I" perspective
- Add a disclaimer at the end of the page using the block quote style. Also using the generated color scheme but a more subtle secondary version of it. Short text. No line breaks. Secondary text color with disclosing the following information: That the page was auto generated, which model was used, when it was generated with human readable timestamp, a short version of the prompt used to generate the content.

List of cards
- Each page shows extracted content as cards 
- each card can be based on one or more posts
- link back to these posts
- Before generating, read all the posts but don't change anything
- limit items to top 11. Rank by interestingness

Card content
