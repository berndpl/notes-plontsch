## Hi. Bernd here.

I am a hands on product designer with engineering background. I create helpful and friendly experiences with the individual in mind, sometimes millions of them.

Currently I work for Microsoft AI, focussing on device experiences and unique form factors. Every thought I share on this page is my own.

I also roast coffee using a popcorn popper and build the occasional app for experimentation.

If you are around, let's meet.
