> Framing a job as something you do (a role, a set of tasks) rather than something you are (your identity) has both benefits and risks.

> Positive implications
	•	Resilience to setbacks: Failure at work feels less like a failure of self.
	•	Work–life balance: Identity isn’t consumed by the job, making it easier to prioritize family, health, or hobbies.
	•	Flexibility: Easier to change careers or adapt when circumstances shift.

> Possible negative effects
* Reduced sense of belonging: If colleagues see their job as identity, you might feel less integrated or less motivated.
* Lower meaning: Some people find purpose in tying identity to work. Seeing it as “just a job” might reduce engagement or passion.
* Recognition gap: In cultures where status is tied to profession, distancing identity from job could make you feel undervalued socially.
	•	Motivation risk: Without identity connection, it might be harder to sustain effort during boring or difficult stretches.
