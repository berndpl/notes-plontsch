Hi. I’m Bernd | ˈbænd |

I am a product designer with engineering background. I create helpful and friendly experiences with the individual in mind, sometimes millions of them.

Currently I work for Microsoft at the Surface team, designing device experiences.

I also roast coffee using a popcorn popper and make an app called Drip.

If you are around, let's meet for a coffee.
